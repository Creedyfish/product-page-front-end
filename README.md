## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/) - For Usable Components

### What I learned

I finally was able to try out UI libraries for the first time. I find it to be a bit more rigid that what I would have liked. NextUI has some useful compnents that have made some manual css and functions easier, but since it was my first time using these libraries. I am hopefull that I would be able to learn and be able to apply solme flexibility in time.
